Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a collection of techniques, methodologies and tools that help with the production of a high quality software system, with a given budget before a given deadline while changes occurs. It is important since it ensures software meets quality standards and functional requirements, to meet customers' needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
rise of agile methodologies- focused on increasing the speed and reliability of software releases.
structured programming- improving code clarity
object oriented programming- reusable, flexible and maintainable codes

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design-software architecture and user interface.
Implementation-writing code and building software according to design specification.
Testing-ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirement.
Deployment-releasing software to users
Maintenance-ongoing updates and enhancement of software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall method is a systematic, sequential approach to software development while agile is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
waterfall- construction of a bridge
agile- developing an e-commerce website

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-writes the code and implement software solution.
Quality assurance engineer-ensures quality of software by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager- oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs-provide built-in support for various programming languages, frameworks, and tools i.e Visual Studio
VCS- enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without conflicts i.e Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirement- plan ahead before going on with the requirement and make sure all needs are met
Tight deadline-reassesment of timeline regularly
Technical Debt- reassesment of project goals

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit-test individual components
integration- test interaction between different components.
system-test entire system as a whole.
acceptance- test software against user requirement to ensure it meets users' needs
their importance is to ensure a high quality software by testing it in different phases

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is a way to structure your text, question to be given relevant, accurate desired response that is useful.Prompt engineering can be used to mitigate these biases by providing carefully crafted prompts that encourage fairness and inclusivity.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague-Write something about cats- 
improved- Write a short, interesting story (approximately 100 words) about a cat named Pal who accidentally gets stuck inside a kennel. The story should be written in a warm tone and aimed at children aged 4-8
more effective because- states the desired output,provides a subjec a cat named Pal,By adding the constraints, and details, the AI now has a much better idea of the users intent.
